# Text Visualizer

Text Visualizer is a tool to visualize text data to improve your academic paper.
Currently it shows data for word count, sentence length, punctuation and stopwords.

This project is the result of the visualization course for [media computer science](https://www.medieninformatik.th-koeln.de/) at the [cologne university of applied sciences](https://www.th-koeln.de/).

You can find documentation for the different parts of this program in the corresponding subfolders.
