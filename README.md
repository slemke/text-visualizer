# Text Visualizer

Text Visualizer is a concept to visualize text data to improve your academic paper. Currently it shows data for word count, sentence length, punctuation and stopwords.

This project was implemented by:

* [Sascha Lemke](https://github.com/slemke)
* [Dennis Dubbert](https://github.com/ddubbert)

This project is the result of the visualization course for [media computer science](https://www.medieninformatik.th-koeln.de/) at the [cologne university of applied sciences](https://www.th-koeln.de/). You can find the documentation for the different parts of this program in the corresponding subfolders.
